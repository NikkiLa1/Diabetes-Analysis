<h2>Description</h2>
This project revolves around predicting the likelihood of individuals having diabetes using machine learning techniques, with a primary focus on the Kaggle dataset named "Diabetes dataset." Employing both unsupervised (K-Means clustering) and supervised (Artificial Neural Network and Naive Bayes Classifier) machine learning models, the study aims to explore the dataset's complexities and unveil patterns for accurate predictions. The Naive Bayes Classifier emerges as a robust choice, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity, particularly vital in medical contexts where interpretability is paramount. While supervised models outshine unsupervised approaches, the project suggests avenues for improvement through advanced modeling techniques and enhanced feature engineering. Overall, the study highlights the potential of machine learning in diabetes prediction and encourages further exploration for refined results.
